A Python-based framework for simulation and design of LLC resonant converters (Half-Bridge, Full-Wave Rectifier) using PySpice/ngspice.

📄 **[Documentation (PDF)](Documentation__LLC_Resonant_Converter_Simulation_Based_Analysis_Framework.pdf)** — full methodology, circuit model, steady-state detection algorithm, and optimisation formulation.

## ▶️ How to Run

Open `code/main.py` and set each flag to `True` or `False` to choose which examples to execute:

```python
RUN_01_BASIC     = True    # Basic single transient simulation
RUN_02_SS        = True    # Simulate until steady state (block-by-block)
RUN_03_PEAK      = True    # Peak-gain frequency mapping
RUN_04_VO_SINGLE = True    # Single operating point — convergence plot
RUN_05_VO_BATCH  = True    # Batch operating-point evaluation
RUN_GA           = False   # GA optimisation — long-running, off by default
RUN_PLOT_GA      = False   # Plot GA results (reads CSVs from /results/ga/)
```

Then click **Reproducible Run**. Results are saved to the **Files → results/** panel.

## 📋 Examples

| Flag | Script | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RUN_01_BASIC` | `Example.py` | Single transient simulation — sanity check |
| `RUN_02_SS` | `Example_Simulate_Until_SS.py` | Simulates cycle-by-cycle until steady state is detected; saves waveform and metrics plots |
| `RUN_03_PEAK` | `Example_Find_Vpeak_ss.py` | Maps the peak-gain curve (maximum achievable Vo vs. fsw) |
| `RUN_04_VO_SINGLE` | `Example_find_Vo_target_single.py` | Finds the switching frequency for a target output voltage at a single operating point; saves convergence plot |
| `RUN_05_VO_BATCH` | `Example_Find_Vo_target.py` | Evaluates multiple operating points in parallel; saves a comparison table (CSV) and waveform PDFs |
| `RUN_GA` | `opt/main_ga.py` | Multi-objective GA optimisation (NSGA-II via pymoo) — can take hours; results in `results/ga/` |
| `RUN_PLOT_GA` | `opt/plot_ga.py` | Generates PDF plots from GA CSV results already in `results/ga/` |

> **Tip:** To run only one example, set all flags to `False` except the one you want.
